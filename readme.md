Mod for Europa Universalis 5 to change the start date to 1444-11-11, and make some gameplay adjustments to accomodate the change.

Does what it says on the tin innit.

The starting setup is still a work in progress. If you would like to help, feel free to fork and open a pull request, or add one of us on steam to discuss details (view contrbutors page on workshop)
